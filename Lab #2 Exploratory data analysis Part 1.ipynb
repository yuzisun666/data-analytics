    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Histograms, boxplots, density plots are used to understand the distributions of numerical variables\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Bivariate Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple or overlayed 1-D plots are used to visualize relationships between two numerical variables, two categorical variables, or combination of numerical and categorical data\n",
    "- Scatterplots for visualizing relationships between two numerical data\n",
    "- Smooth scatterplots for visualizing relationships between two numerical data (when we have a lot of data points)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multivariate Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coplots (conditonal plots), multiple or overlayed 2-D plots are used to show the relationship between two variables as a third (or more) variable changes\n",
    "- Using color, size, and/or shape to add dimension: plotting points with different colors or shapes is useful for indicating a third dimension, where different colors can indicate different categories or ranges of something. Plotting symbols with different sizes can also achieve the same effect when the third dimension is numerical (continuous variable)\n",

    "#### 5.1 Reading Data into Python from a CSV file\n",
    "\n",
    "To read a dataset into Python, we will use a predefined procedure or method that comes with a Python package called `pandas`. The `pandas` Python package is very powerful, and it is the most used Python package for data science. It provides data scientists with tools to read data in different formats (text, excel, web, JSON, etc.). In addition, it provides functionalities to explore the data, manipulate and clean the data. We will dive deeper into `pandas` and its functionalities in the coming modules, but for now, I will show you how to use it to read CSV data files. CSV files are text files and the data is seperate with commas (CSV stands for comma seperated values). While you are able to open them in Excel, CSV files are NOT Excel files. They are text files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other types of text data files are TSV files (tab seperated values). The `cardio` data file is a csv file, so we will use `pandas` functionalities to read it into Python as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "PS. Python packages extend the core Python distribution. When you install Python, such packages are not installed generally. Since we used Anaconda to install Python, some packages are installed automatically and all we need to do is just `import` them to our Jupyter notebooks. Anaconda comes with the following data science packages installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and many others)."
